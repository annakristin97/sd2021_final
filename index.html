									<p> Traffic collisions are one of the most pressing problems facing the world, 
										as they result in numerous deaths, injuries, and fatalities each year, as 
										well as significant economic losses. With the help of data analysis, 
										the question <em>“Under what circumstances are traffic accidents more 
										likely to occur?”</em> will be explored and answered.  <br/>

										To do so, historic data from the city of Seattle is used from the years 2004 
										to the end of 2020. Different data visualizations are used to present the variant 
										results that were explored and to highlight key findings. <br/>
										
										This analysis is designated for the healthcare system, furthermore the four 
										main hospitals that have ER’s (Emergency Room) in Seattle. The analysis is 
										done to explore how different circumstances and different time periods can 
										influence the severity of an accident and how the hospitals can be better 
										prepared when those severity levels occur.  <br/>
									</p>
									<div style="text-align: center;">
									<h2>ACCIDENTS DURING DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS</h2>
									</div>
									<div>
										<p style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 35px;"><img src="AccidentsYear.png" 
											height="330px" width="370px" border="5px"> 
											<br/>
											<span align="center"><em>Figure 1</em></span></p>
										<p> To get an better idea on when most accidents are happening, it was decided to 
											start by looking at the different time periods over the years, it is interesting 
											to see on <em>Figure 1</em>, that traffic accidents have been declining over the years. Where there
											was a spike in 2015, but then it went delining again, accidents went from over 15.000 per 
											year to less than 12.000. <br /> 
											<br /> 
											One might think that traffic accidents tend to happen more in wintertime rather than summertime. 
											However, <em>Figure 2 </em>shows otherwise. By displaying the accident count in a 
											heatmap, the results show that the distribution over the months of the year. 
											The months are quite similar, but from the graph it can be seen that Sundays and 
											February are the most "calm" periods. On the otherhand Fridays and October are the "busiest" periods.
											Dark coloring of the cell indicate, a high count of occurrences and light coloring indicates
											low counts of occurrences.
											Traffic accident can therefore happen at any time of the 
											year but there is a slight varience in October and February.<br /> 
											<br /> 
											<em>Figure 3</em> shows the difference between 
											the weeks of the year to see whether the beginning 
											of the month varies with the end of it. However, as expected, there does not seem to be 
											any clear pattern between weeks, only the weekdays. <br />
											<br /> 
											So now let's look into the pattern of hours over the weekday, <em>Figure 4 </em>displays 
											the count of accidents on different weekdays vs. the hour of the day in another heatmap. 
											Here we can clearly see a noticeable difference. Traffic accidents seem to be more likely to 
											occur on business days (Monday - Friday) between 15:00 – 18:00. </p>

										<h4>So what do these result mean for hospitals?</h4>
									<p>
										Everyday there are many accidents happening, but only fraction of the all accident need 
										to go to the hospital and that more likely from sever accidents. The previous results 
										gave a good indication of the busiest time of traffic collisions. But what about the 
										difference in severity ? Does this also apply to different cases of severity ?

										<h2>Factors that can affect the frequency and severity of accidents</h2>
										</div>	
										<p style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 35px;"><img src="RoadCond.png" 
											height="280px" width="320px" border="5px"> 
											<br/>
											<span align="center"><em>Figure 5</em></span></p>									
										<p> Now looking into the severity level of accident and what other factors may play a role
											in the severness. First of all, <em>Figure 5</em> shows three types of road condition;
											Dry, Wet and Icy, this is done to get a good visual comparison 
											on how "dangerous" each road condition is. An normalised count of road condition 
											type accidents, is visulised and contrary to what one might probably think - it seems 
											that accidents are more likely to happen on dry roads than wet or icy. <br/>
											<br/>

											<em>But what other factor might have impact on the accident severness? </em>

											Looking at the graph down below. 
											The graph shows a normalised count of collision logs for each severity code, for five 
											different factors that might be connected to the severness of accident. 
											The severity codes are four and are represented in the following way: 
											<li> <strong>1: Property Damage </strong> </li>
											<li> <strong>2: Injury </strong>  </li> 
											<li> <strong>2b: Serious Injury </strong> </li> 
											<li> <strong>3: Fatality </strong> </li>  
											
											Five different categories are explored based on their severity level. 
											Each category is shown in different tab at the top of the graph, where it can be 
											switched between in an interactive way. It also allows the feature to select and filter
											the specific severity level. 
											<br>

										<p style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 35px;"><img src="DUI.png" 
											height="280px" width="320px" border="5px"> 
											<br/>
											<span align="center"><em>Figure 6</em></span></p>

										<p> Based on the graph, it is obvious that the type of collision, road- and light 
											condition and whether driver was under influence (DUI), play an immense role in the 
											severity level of the traffic accident. <br/>
											What is interesting to see is that fatalities are more likely to occur in the 
											middle of the night and in the evening. There seems to be a connection between
											the severity level of accident and with the DUI value, as a majority of the fatalities 
											occur when a person is driving under influence. Therefore looking at <em>Figure 6</em>,
											that shows the count of DUI occurrences distributed over the hour of day, there is an obvious
											increasment of accidents as the night progresses and that also explains the increasement
											of severness factor during the night. <br/>
											<br/>
											Every day, 29 people in the United States die in motor vehicle crashes that 
											involve an alcohol-impaired driver [1]. This is one death every 50 minutes. 
											The annual cost of alcohol-related crashes totals more than $44 billion [2]. <br/>
										
											This enormous cost affects the hospitals as well since they need excess 
											healthcare workers to handle these severe cases.

										<h2>Where are the accidents happening?</h2>
										</div>
										<p> <strong>Which of the accidents are severe and when is hospitalisation needed? </strong> <br/>
											To visualize where the collisions are taking place, an interactive map above shows 
											the collisions for each severity code. Severity code 2 is coloured orange, 
											2b is dark orange and 3 is coloured red. <br/>
											To display the nearest Emergency Room (ER), markers have been placed in the map 
											to indicate the location. The map also allows the features to select the type of 
											severity to be displayed on the map itself. 

											In the interactive map, collisions logs are colored by their severity,
											where severity code 2 is colored orange, 2b is dark orange and 3 is colored red.
											Markers has been placed on the map where the next Emergency Room (ER) is located.
											The interactive map, allows the features to select the type of severity to be displayed
											on the map itself. <br/>
											<br/>

											The ERs seem to be well distributed around the city so no injury hotspot is very far 
											away. The main hotspots for fatalities occur on the big roads or highways which can 
											be explained by the high-speed limit and the number of cars going through these roads.

											<h2>Want to explore machine Learning?</h2>
										</div>
											<p> Here a Decision Tree with a Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm 
												will help to make an educated guess on whether an injury will result in 
												an ER case. Research show that RF is good to implement on traffic accident 
												data and has outperformed the other methods [3]. <br/> 

												<em>Figure 7</em> shows how a Decision Tree for the analysis of Seattle traffic 
												collision analysis is displayed. This algorithm has a ~70 % accuracy 
												performance and can predict the traffic accident severity on whether it 
												is an ER case or not. <br/>
												
												To help interpret the tree, the numerical value for each Collision Type 
												column is presented in the Table down below.  <br/>

												<table>
													<tr>
													  <th>0</th>
													  <th>1</th>
													  <th>2</th>
													  <th>3</th>
													  <th>4</th>
													  <th>5</th>

													  <td>Nan</td>
													</tr>
												  </table>

												The categories “Weekday”, “Hour”, “Month” are presented in a numerical way, 
												meaning that for 0 is Monday, 1 is Tuesday and so on. 0 in months is 
												therefore January and 0 in hours is 00:00 o’clock. <br/>

												Now let’s test it out. 
												<li>Say we have an accident that includes <u>Cycles</u> </li>

												<li>Since Cycles are equal to 1, we travel from the first branch down 
													to the left one. </li>

												<li>Then down to the right to the second branch and then to the left 
													to the third branch.</li>

												<li>Now we are located on the “HOUR” category where we need to state 
													what time of day the accident is happening, let’s say it is during the day.  </li>

												<li>We finally travel down to the last leaf of the tree where we get our 
													odds for the ER. As seen on the pie chart, it is pretty likely that this 
													cycle accident collision will end up at the ER. </li>

											<h2> Summary of the results</h2>
										</div>
											<p>
												Summarising all the results and mainly answering the questions <em>Under 
												what circumstances are accidents more likely to occur and what 
												factors may impact the severeness?</em> <br/>

												Well, first of all, there was an obvious pattern of traffic accidents
												 occurrence during the hour of the day and what weekday it is. The 
												 most frequent time for an accident occurring is on business days when 
												 people are likely driving home from work and that is between 14:00 - 18:00. 
												 Sundays were "calm", where there are least of accidents happening and over 
												 the years accidents have been decreasing. <br/>
												 <br/>
												There was though clear pattern between severeness of accident, time 
												of day and if a driver was under influence. How can these results 
												become of use for the healthcare system though? Well by looking at 
												the "busiest" time of accidents, they are able to predict the incoming 
												workload based on the weekday and hour of the day. The decision tree 
												could come of a good use to use other relevant factors, such as the 
												road- and light condition, the predicted severity level, and common accident
												 places. People are unpredictable, many key factors play a role in predicting 
												 accidents, but the major ones can be used. Historic data shows obvious 
												 patterns and gives a good indication of influential factors of the 
												 severity level and reasoning. <br/>
